# Security
## Scope
AtomicFramework's scope of security focuses on access to a user's device from the network.

Due to the nature of modding, AtomicFramework cannot be held responsible for the nature of the
very much arbitrary code being executed within other mods.

Additionally, it is unlikely that AtomicFramework will contribute to a privilege escalation or
pivot outside of some very unusual configuration given the nature of the work.

Finally, whilst we denounce cheating and abuse of our framework to support such misbehaviour,
such issues fall outside of the scope of this project's security.

## Reporting
For issues within the scope of the AtomicFramework security project, reporting is available on the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/TYKUHN2/AtomicFramework/security/advisories/new).

Prior to reporting, please ensure that the issue is present within AtomicFramework itself and
within the scope of the project.
